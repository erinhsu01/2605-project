Firstly, from a purely computational point of view, computing the LU and QR decomposition matrices requires fewer operations than calculating inverse matrices. While it may not make much of a difference in this limited context, matrix calculations can become very computationally taxing with each increase in the size of a matrix. The most efficient algorithms require more than O(n^2) operations for an n by n matrix, with exponential complexity being something to vigorously avoid if possible. In the context of complex calculations where matrices can be in the sizes of hundreds or thousands, this could represent a processing bottleneck which mitigates the usefulness of a system at all. Using QR or LU factorization can reduce this complexity, and while it still cannot reach the goal of linear time, the time can still be reduced by almost a third. This represents a significant benefit by itself, but the primary benefit of using factorization over inverse matrices is the reduction in error. These methods require fewer transformations, which in turn reduces the potential for error, and the resulting upper triangle matrices allow for a great deal of flexibility. This system can be solved very quickly with backwards substitution, and with a condition number of one, the error is optimally minimized. As such, using QR and LU factorization methods are the most optimal ways of solving linear systems for their reduction in computational complexity and their reduction of error, which yield increasing benefits as the size of matrices increases.
