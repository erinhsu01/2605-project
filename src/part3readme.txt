Part 3 ReadMe
_____________________________________________

To run Part 3, compile the Part3 java file by entering into the command line
once you are in the correct directory:

    javac Part3.java

Once the source file is compiled, in the command line, run the program by entering into the command line:

    java Part3

This will create 1000 matrices, open the Java application, and display the two
graphs in the application with each point in the graph being the respective
determinant vs. trace of that particular matrix with color being directed by the
number of iterations that matrix needed.

To run the program again, close the Java application window and run

    java Part3

again in the command line.
